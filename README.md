## Click to open links in the browser
Adds the ability to ctrl-click (cmd-click on macs) links and open them in the default browser.

This is a fork with ~~some fixes~~ one fix:
- softwrapped links are not broken


### Installation

```

Requires [language-hyperlink](https://atom.io/packages/language-hyperlink) to be installed and enabled.
